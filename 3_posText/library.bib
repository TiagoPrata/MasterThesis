abstract = {With decades of successful application of model predictive control (MPC) to industrial processes, practitioners are now focused on ease of commissioning, monitoring, and automation of maintenance. Many industries do not necessarily need better algorithms, but rather improved usability of existing technologies to allow a limited workforce of varying expertise to easily commission, use, and maintain these valued applications. Continuous performance monitoring, and automated model re-identification are being used as vendors work to deliver automated adaptive MPC. This paper examines industrial practice and emerging research trends towards providing sustained MPC performance.},

abstract = {Model-based design is well recognized in industry as a systematic approach to the development, evaluation, and implementation of feedback controllers. Model predictive control (MPC) is a particular branch of model-based design: a dynamical model of the open-loop process is explicitly used to construct an optimization problem aimed at achieving the prescribed system's performance under specified restrictions on input and output variables. The solution of the optimization problem provides the feedback control action, and can be either computed by embedding a numerical solver in the real-time control code, or pre-computed off-line and evaluated through a lookup table of linear feedback gains. This paper reviews the basic ideas of MPC design, from the traditional linear MPC setup based on quadratic programming to more a advanced explicit and hybrid MPC, and highlights available software tools for the design, evaluation, code generation, and deployment of MPC controllers in real-time hardware platforms},

abstract = {The framework of reinforcement learning or optimal control provides a mathe-matical formalization of intelligent decision making that is powerful and broadly applicable. While the general form of the reinforcement learning problem enables effective reasoning about uncertainty, the connection between reinforcement learn-ing and inference in probabilistic models is not immediately obvious. However, such a connection has considerable value when it comes to algorithm design: for-malizing a problem as probabilistic inference in principle allows us to bring to bear a wide array of approximate inference tools, extend the model in flexible and powerful ways, and reason about compositionality and partial observability. In this article, we will discuss how a generalization of the reinforcement learning or optimal control problem, which is sometimes termed maximum entropy rein-forcement learning, is equivalent to exact probabilistic inference in the case of deterministic dynamics, and variational inference in the case of stochastic dynam-ics. We will present a detailed derivation of this framework, overview prior work that has drawn on this and related ideas to propose new reinforcement learning and control algorithms, and describe perspectives on future research.},

Traditionally, the design of feedback controllers for linear systems with constraints, for example anti-windup techniques, was ad hoc requiring both much experience and trial and error.

abstract = {Model Predictive Control (MPC) technology is widely used in chemical process industries. Subspace identification (SID) on the other hand has proven to be an efficient alternative for classical system identification methods. Based on the results from MPC and SID, it was developed in the late 90's a new control approach, called Subspace Predictive Control (SPC). This approach is also known as data-driven predictive control. In this new method, one single operation replaces the three steps in a MPC controller design: system identification, the state observer design and the predictor matrices construction. The aim of this work is to review studies in the field of SPC, to apply this technology to typical systems of chemical industry and to propose new algorithms. It is developed three internal excitation algorithms for the SPC method, which allow the system to be persistently excited while a minimal control of the process is still guaranteed. These algorithms enable the application of closed- loop identification, where the SPC controller model is re-identified using the previously excited data. The SPC controller and the SPC controller with internal excitation are tested through simulation for two different processes. The first one is a debutanizer column of a distillation unit for which two linear models corresponding to two different operating points are available. The second one is a non-linear system consisting of a styrene polymerization reactor. A phenomenological model is provided for this system. Tests results indicate that SPC is more susceptible to measurement noises. However, it is noticed that SPC controller corrects perturbations on set-points faster than MPC. Simulations for the SPC with internal excitation show that the proposed algorithms sufficiently excite the system, in the sense that more precise models are obtained from the re-identification with excited data.},

When a change in the operating point is required this NL model is used to identify a linear ARX model of the process. The optimization procedure is then executed using this linear model and a control weighting factor adapted to the nonlinear model static gain obtained from the inverse static characteristic. The proposed controller is applied to some simulated NL process and the obtained results compared to some MPC algorithms recently presented in literature to show the main advantages of this new approach: simplicity, low processing time and uniform dynamic behaviour in the operating range.},

abstract = {The ore processing allows a significative recovery and maximizes the investment return on a process of this nature. Flotation is a step in this process, the flotation column being one of concentration equipment most used in the mineral industry. Achieving better concentrations, greater metallurgical efficiency and less capital investment are some of the reasons for such importance. As the flotation process is multivariable, this work investigates the implementation of a predictive multivariable controller for operating a typical flotation column. This controller was tested using a model with delays of a prototype column mounted on Nuclear Technology Development Center (CDTN). Taking as input signals the flushing wash water, air feeding and non floated fraction flow rates, the controller determines the froth layer height and air holdup in the recovery zone. This control maintains stability. The operation of the controller is based on the optimization of a cost function. The conducted tests were based on the change of setpoint of the controlled variables. It was intended to analyze the system behavior for different operation conditions, con- sidering the constraints of the process and the response speed.},

abstract = {The concepts of Model Predictive Control (MPC) and Moving Horizon Estimation (MHE) received widespread acceptance in both industry and academia. This is due to the ability to explicitly define objectives and constraints in the framework of dynamic optimization. Those key facts eventually lead to improved control performance. Progress in the area of optimization algorithms and computational hardware in the last two decades have extended the applicability of numerical optimization to mechatronics applications. In particular, the applicability was extended for small-scale systems with time constants in micro- and millisecond range. Following the success convex quadratic programming (QP) solvers made in linear MPC, the ideas have been extended for nonlinear MPC and MHE. This thesis aims to further reduce the gap between academia and industry. With optimized software for nonlinear MPC and MHE and extended problem formulations we can efficiently handle complex nonlinear systems, possibly working under nonlinear constraints. We present recent extensions to the ACADO Code Generation Tool (CGT). Once specified, the problem structure is exploited offline by the tool that generates the tailored code optimized for execution in real-time environments. We demonstrate the strength of the newly developed features of the tool in numerical simulations and two real-world applications. Our numerical simulations show readiness to effectively treat problems on both short and long horizons. For the systems with a few states and few controls solution times in the microsecond range are observed. Our largest test case involves an MPC formulation comprising 33 states, 3 controls, and a prediction horizon of 50 steps. This test case comprises 1800 optimization variables and is possible to solve on modern hardware in under 50 milliseconds. For another test problem where long prediction horizons are the necessity, we observe solution times less than 4 milliseconds in a test case with the horizon of 150 steps. The first experimental study is the application of nonlinear MPC and MHE to a laboratory scale overhead crane. Here we present computational performance of two generations of the ACADO CGT. Using the original implementation of the tool and only an MPC controller in the first control scenario, we achieved execution times close to 1 millisecond. With the recently optimized code, we attained nearly the same execution times, now with both nonlinear MHE and the MPC in the loop. In addition, with the more optimized code we reached average runtimes for the nonlinear MPC three times faster than with the original implementation. The aim of the second real-world application is to validate the computational performance of the auto-generated MHE and MPC solvers on an experimental setup for rotational start-up of an airborne wind energy system. The system model describes complex nonlinear dynamics comprising 27 differential states, 1 algebraic state and 4 controls. The results confirm that nonlinear MPC formulation with more than 1500 optimization variables is solved in just less than 5 milliseconds reducing the total feedback time to below 10 milliseconds.},

abstract = {Friction is a nonlinear phenomenon that is present in almost all motion systems. Friction often limits systems performance by causing tracking and positioning errors and limit cycles. When these errors are unacceptable, the effect of friction needs to be compensated by the system controller, which estimates the friction force and feed this estimate back to the drives. Both model-free and modelbased friction force estimation approaches exist. This thesis focuses on the modeling of friction and model-based friction estimation. Accurate model-based friction estimation is obtained provided that the friction model structure includes all major physical characteristics, and accurate realtime estimation of the model states and parameters is performed. This thesis presents a novel advanced friction model and a moving horizon estimator that allows to estimate model parameters and states in real-time. Moving horizon estimation (MHE) is an optimal control approach aiming to find the states and parameters of the system that are most consistent with current and past input-output data and the available system model. Moreover, real-time MHE is a gradient-based estimation technique that greatly benefits from a model that is differentiable with regards to state and parameter. Accurate friction models, which include all essential friction characteristics, as the generalized Maxwell-slip (GMS) model, are hybrid models with switching state conditions between presliding and sliding motion. To overcome these switching conditions, a smoothed version of the GMS model, called S-GMS, which consists of a set of differential equations well suited for gradient-based estimation is developed. Similar to the GMS model, the S-GMS model is a multi-state model that also describes all essential friction characteristics. A MHE friction observer is implemented for both the S-GMS model and the standard single-state LuGre model. Experimental state and parameter estimation shows the benefit of the multi-state S-GMS in presliding regime, where complex hysteresis behavior occurs. Moreover, a real-time embedded MHE friction observer is implemented for the S-GMS model via the automatic code generation tool ACADO and validated on a high-precision direct-drive linear motor. A sampling time in the millisecond range is achieved.},

abstract = {Our goal in this text is to provide a comprehensive and foundational treatment of the theory and design of model predictive control (MPC). By now several excellent monographs emphasizing various aspects of MPC have appeared (a list appears at the beginning of Chapter 1), and the reader may naturally wonder what is offered here that is new and different. By providing a comprehensive treatment of the MPC foun- dation, we hope that this text enables researchers to learn and teach the fundamentals of MPC without continuously searching the diverse control research literature for omitted arguments and requisite back- ground material. When teaching the subject, it is essential to have a collection of exercises that enables the students to assess their level of comprehension and mastery of the topics. To support the teaching and learning of MPC, we have included more than 200 end-of-chapter exer- cises. A complete solution manual (more than 300 pages) is available for course instructors. Chapter 1 is introductory. It is intended for graduate students in en- gineering who have not yet had a systems course. But it serves a second purpose for those who have already taken the first graduate systems course. It derives all the results of the linear quadratic regulator and optimal Kalman filter using only those arguments that extend to the nonlinear and constrained cases to be covered in the later chapters. Instructors may find that this tailored treatment of the introductory systems material serves both as a review and a preview of arguments to come in the later chapters. Chapters 2–4 are foundational and should probably be covered in any graduate level MPC course. Chapter 2 covers regulation to the ori- gin for nonlinear and constrained systems. This material presents in a unified fashion many of the major research advances in MPC that took place during the last 20 years. It also includes more recent topics such as regulation to an unreachable setpoint that are only now appearing in the research literature. Chapter 3 addressesMPCdesign for robustness, with a focus on MPC using tubes or bundles of trajectories in place of the single nominal trajectory. This chapter again unifies a large body of research literature concerned with robust MPC. Chapter 4 covers state estimation with an emphasis on moving horizon estimation, but also covers extended and unscented Kalman filtering, and particle filtering. Chapters 5–7 present more specialized topics. Chapter 5 addresses the special requirements of MPC based on output measurement instead of state measurement. Chapter 6 discusses how to design distributed MPC controllers for large-scale systems that are decomposed into many smaller, interacting subsystems. Chapter 7 covers the explicit optimal control of constrained linear systems. The choice of coverage of these three chapters may vary depending on the instructor's or student's own research interests. Three appendices are included, again, so that the reader is not sent off to search a large research literature for the fundamental arguments used in the text. Appendix A covers the required mathematical back- ground. Appendix B summarizes the results used for stability analysis including the various types of stability and Lyapunov function theory. Since MPC is an optimization-based controller, Appendix C covers the relevant results from optimization theory. In order to reduce the size and expense of the text, the three appendices are available on the web: www.che.wisc.edu/{\~{}}jbraw/mpc. Note, however, that all material in the appendices is included in the book's printed table of contents, and subject and author indices. The website also includes sample exams, and homework assignments for a one-semester graduate course in MPC. All of the examples and exercises in the text were solved with Octave. Octave is freely available from www.octave.org.},

abstract = {— This paper presents and discusses the trajectory tracking control design with friction compensation for a three wheeled omnidirectional mobile robot. Firstly, a dynamic model without considering the friction forces is derived. Part of the control effort is used to compensate the friction effects, which is estimated by an extended state observer without using a friction model. Then traditional resolved acceleration control is applied to the robot, based on the derived dynamic model. In addition, stability analysis of the controller and observer is presented. Experimental results show that the proposed control design is efficient in compensating the friction effects and in improving the tracking control performances.},

The second edition of Model Predictive Control provides a thorough introduction to theoretical and practical aspects of the most commonly used MPC strategies. It bridges the gap between the powerful but often abstract techniques of control researchers and the more empirical approach of practitioners. Model Predictive Control demonstrates that a powerful technique does not always require complex control algorithms. The text features material on the following subjects: general MPC elements and algorithms; commercial MPC schemes; generalized predictive control multivariable, robust, constrained nonlinear and hybrid MPC; fast methods for MPC implementation; applications. All of the material is thoroughly updated for the second edition with the chapters on nonlinear MPC, MPC and hybrid systems and MPC implementation being entirely new. Many new exercises and examples have also have also been added throughout and MATLAB{\textregistered}programs to aid in their solution can be downloaded from extras.springer.com.

@article{Haseltine2005,
abstract = {State estimators for physical processes often must address different challenges, including nonlinear dynamics, states subject to hard constraints (e.g., nonnegative concentrations), and local optima. In this article, we compare the performance of two such estimators:? the extended Kalman filter (EKF) and moving-horizon estimation (MHE). We outline conditions that lead to the formation of multiple optima in the estimator for systems tending to a steady state and propose tests that determine when these conditions hold for chemical reaction networks. Several simulation examples demonstrate estimation failure in the EKF, even in the absence of plant?model mismatch. We then examine the role that constraints play in determining the performance on these examples of MHE employing local optimization and a ?smoothing? update for the arrival cost. This implementation of MHE represents a feasible, on-line alternative to the EKF for industrial practitioners. In each example, the two estimators are given exactly the same information, namely, tuning parameters, model, and measurements; yet MHE consistently provides improved state estimation and greater robustness to both poor guesses of the initial state and tuning parameters in comparison to the EKF. The only price of this improvement is the greater computational expense required to solve the MHE optimization.},

The choice of horizon size allows the user to achieve a compromise between the better pe{\$}ormance of the batch least-squares solution and the reduced computational requirements of the approximate nonlinear filters.

This combination enables automatically tuning the parameters in conventional model predictive control (MPC); and therefore provides a solution to the problem of fault tolerant MPC design. The existing SPCs either deal with open-loop data or depend on the information of the controller in a closed loop. In this paper we introduce a new closed-loop SPC method, which is independent of any controller information. Both the analytic solution to the unconstrained case and the quadratic programming problem for the constrained case are formulated. A recursive solution for updating the SPC control law is proposed. A fault tolerant MPC scheme is then developed based on the recursive algorithm, whose effectiveness is demonstrated on tolerating a fault in a steer-by-wire actuator.

Explicit MPC tools are employed to synthesize the controller to quickly assess controller complexity, local stability of the closed-loop dynamics, and for rapid prototype testing. Then, the controller is fine-tuned by refining the linear prediction model through identification from experimental data, and by adjusting from observed experimental performance the values of weights and noise covariances for filter design.

abstract = {Model predictive control (MPC) has a long history in the field of control engineering. It is one of the few areas that has received on-going interest from researchers in both the industrial and academic communities. Four major aspects of model predictive control make the design methodology attractive to both practitioners and academics. The first aspect is the design formulation, which uses a completely multivariable system framework where the performance parameters of the multivariable control system are related to the engineering aspects of the system; hence, they can be understood and ‘tuned' by engineers. The second aspect is the ability of the method to handle both ‘soft' constraints and hard constraints in a multivariable control framework. This is particularly attractive to industry where tight profit margins and limits on the process operation are inevitably present. The third aspect is the ability to perform on-line process optimization. The fourth aspect is the simplicity of the design framework in handling all these complex issues. This book gives an introduction to model predictive control, and recent developments in design and implementation. Beginning with an overview of the field, the book will systematically cover topics in receding horizon control, MPC design formulations, constrained control, Laguerre-function-based predictive control, predictive control using exponential data weighting, reformulation of classical predictive control, tuning of predictive control, as well as simulation and implementation using MATLAB and SIMULINK as a platform. Both continuous-time and discrete-time model predictive control is presented in a similar framework.},

The accuracy of this global model is discussed and several simulation examples are investigated in order to study the validity of the obtained neural network global model.

Our work builds on the synergistic relationship between local model-based control, global value function learning, and exploration. We study how local trajectory optimization can cope with approximation errors in the value function, and can stabilize and accelerate value function learning. Conversely, we also study how approximate value functions can help reduce the planning horizon and allow for better policies beyond local solutions. Finally, we also demonstrate how trajectory optimization can be used to perform temporally coordinated exploration in conjunction with estimating uncertainty in value function approximation. This exploration is critical for fast and stable learning of the value function. Combining these components enable solutions to complex control tasks, like humanoid locomotion and dexterous in-hand manipulation, in the equivalent of a few minutes of experience in the real world.},

@phdthesis{Morabito2015,
abstract = {The Moving Horizon Estimation (MHE) is a technique that allows to estimate the states of a system considering constraints, either when they are affected by noise or are not measured. This method can be associated with control techniques such as Model Predictive Control (MPC). The core of the mathematics formulation of MHE consists of an optimization problem that can easily become huge as the horizon and the number of states of the system increase. This leads inevitably to a large computational time that makes difficult the implementation of the algorithm for on-line purpose. In this work we develop a fast and simple algorithm that solves the MHE problem using the Nesterov's Fast Gradient Method that, under certain assumption, solves the optimization problem faster than using the standard optimization algorithms such as Interior Point Method or Active Set Method. Contrary to the MPC problem, the Hessian resulting from the MHE is timevarying. This poses a problem on the calculation of the eigenvalues which are required by the Fast Gradient method, therefore we implement also a fast algorithm for obtaining a upper and lower bound on the eigenvalues of the Hessian. The algorithm has been validated through several simulations on linear random systems and then applied on two practical examples. The first consists in applying the MHE together with MPC in a anaerobic digestor for methane production. Anaerobic digestion plants often suffer from a slow and unreliable on-line measurement systems therefore the automatic control is often difficult, for this reason we aim to solve this problem estimating most of the states instead of measuring them so as to apply the control action with the estimated information. The second is a chemical plant section consisting of two CSTR reactors and a nonadiabatic flash separator where we suppose some states are not measurable.},

@incollection{Seborg2011,
abstract = {In this chapter we consider model predictive control (MPC), an important advanced control technique for difficult multivariable control problems. The basic MPC concept can be summarized as follows. Suppose that we wish to control a multiple-input, multiple-output process while satisfying inequality constraints on the input and output variables. If a reasonably accurate dynamic model of the process is available, model and current measurements can be used to predict future values of the outputs. Then the appropriate changes in the input variables can be calculated based on both predictions and measurements. In essence, the changes in the individual input variables are coordi-nated after considering the input-output relationships represented by the process model. In MPC applica-tions, the output variables are also referred to as con-trolled variables or CVs, while the input variables are also called manipulated variables or MVs. Measured disturbance variables are called DVs or feedforward variables. These terms will be used interchangeably in this chapter. Model predictive control offers several important ad-vantages: (1) the process model captures the dynamic and static interactions between input, output, and dis-turbance variables, (2) constraints on inputs and out-puts are considered in a systematic manner, (3) the control calculations can be coordinated with the calcu-lation of optimum set points, and (4) accurate model predictions can provide early warnings of potential problems. Clearly, the success of MPC (or any other model-based approach) depends on the accuracy of the process model. Inaccurate predictions can make mat-ters worse, instead of better. First-generation MPC systems were developed in-dependently in the 1970s by two pioneering industrial research groups. Dynamic Matrix Control (DMC), devised by Shell Oil (Cutler and Ramaker, 1980), and a related approach developed by ADERSA (Richalet et al., 1978) have quite similar capabilities. An adaptive MPC technique, Generalized Predictive Control (GPC), developed by Clarke et al. (1987) has also received considerable attention. Model predic-tive control has had a major impact on industrial practice. For example, an MPC survey by Qin and Badgwell (2003) reported that there were over 4,500 applications worldwide by the end of 1999, primarily in oil refineries and petrochemical plants. In these in-dustries, MPC has become the method of choice for difficult multivariable control problems that include inequality constraints. In view of its remarkable success, MPC has been a popular subject for academic and industrial research. Major extensions of the early MPC methodology have been developed, and theoretical analysis has provided insight into the strengths and weaknesses of MPC. In-formative reviews of MPC theory and practice are available in books (Camacho and Bordons,},

abstract = {Long horizon lengths in Moving Horizon Estimation are desirable to reach the performance limits of the full information estimator. However, the conventional MHE technique suffers from a number of deficiencies in this respect. First, the problem complexity scales at least linearly with the horizon length selected, which restrains from selecting long horizons if computational limitations are present. Second, there is no monitoring of constraint activity/inactivity which results in conducting redundant constrained minimizations even when no constraints are active. In this study we develop a Multiple-Window Moving Horizon Estimation strategy (MW-MHE) that exploits constraint inactivity to reduce the problem size in long horizon estimation problems. The arrival cost is approximated using the unconstrained full information estimator arrival cost to guarantee stability of the technique. A new horizon length selection criteria is developed based on maximum sensitivity between remote states in time. The development will be in terms of general causal descriptor systems, which includes the standard state space representation as a special case. The potential of the new estimation algorithm will be demonstrated with an example showing a significant reduction in both computation time and numerical errors compared to conventional MHE.},

Polytopic uncertainties are employed to encompass both parametric uncretainties in the nonlinear system model and remaining mismatches related to the non-exact feedback linearization. Finally, a Robust MPC (RMPC) controller synthesis procedure is outlined relying on usual relaxed Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMI) conditions that shows superior performance when compared to standard LMIs.},

abstract = {Recent results have suggested that online Model Predictive Control$\backslash$n(MPC) can be computed quickly enough to control fast sampled systems.$\backslash$nHigh-speed applications impose a hard real-time constraint on the$\backslash$nsolution of the MPC problem, which generally prevents the computation$\backslash$nof the optimal controller. In current approaches guarantees on feasibility$\backslash$nand stability are sacrificed in order to achieve a real-time setting.$\backslash$nIn this paper we develop a real-time MPC scheme based on robust MPC$\backslash$ndesign that recovers these guarantees while allowing for extremely$\backslash$nfast computation. We show that a simple warm-start optimization procedure$\backslash$nproviding an enhanced feasible solution guarantees feasibility and$\backslash$nstability for arbitrary time constraints. The proposed method can$\backslash$nbe practically implemented and efficiently solved for dynamic systems$\backslash$nof significant problem size. Implementation details for a real-time$\backslash$nrobust MPC method are provided that achieves computation times equal$\backslash$nto those reported for methods without guarantees. A 12-dimensional$\backslash$nproblem with 3 control inputs and a prediction horizon of 10 time$\backslash$nsteps is solved in 2msec with a performance deterioration less than$\backslash$n1{\%} and thereby allows for sampling rates of 500Hz.},

abstract = {Self-tuning optical systems are of growing importance in technological applications such as mode-locked fiber lasers. Such self-tuning paradigms require {\{}$\backslash$em intelligent{\}} algorithms capable of inferring approximate models of the underlying physics and discovering appropriate control laws in order to maintain robust performance for a given objective. In this work, we demonstrate the first integration of a {\{}$\backslash$em deep learning{\}} (DL) architecture with {\{}$\backslash$em model predictive control{\}} (MPC) in order to self-tune a mode-locked fiber laser. Not only can our DL-MPC algorithmic architecture approximate the unknown fiber birefringence, it also builds a dynamical model of the laser and appropriate control law for maintaining robust, high-energy pulses despite a stochastically drifting birefringence. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on a fiber laser which is mode-locked by nonlinear polarization rotation. The method advocated can be broadly applied to a variety of optical systems that require robust controllers.},

abstract = {System identification is an important way of investigating and understanding the world around. Identification is a process of deriving a mathematical model of a predefined part of the world, using observations. There are several different approaches of system identification, and these approaches utilize different forms of knowledge about the system. When only input-output observations are used behavioral or black box model can be constructed. In black box modeling neural networks play an important role. The purpose of this paper is to give an overview of the application of neural networks in system identification. It defines the task of system identification, shows the basic questions and introduces the different approaches can be applied. It deals with the basic neural network architectures, the capability of neural networks and shows the motivations why neural networks are applied in system identification. The paper presents the main steps of neural identification and details the most important special problems, which must be solved when neural networks are used in system modeling. The general statements are illustrated by a real world complex industrial application example, where important practical questions and the strength and weakness of neural identification are also discussed.},

abstract = {This paper presents a fundamental analysis of the stability of single-input/single-output (SISO), closed-loop systems with predictive controllers. The analysis can be used to calculate allowable modeling errors for a given system and controller. Design parameter selection guidelines for predictive controllers in SISO systems have been developed by considering performance, robustness, and ease of tuning. The performance and robustness of the resulting controllers are demonstrated in four numerical examples and compared to controllers designed using other parameter choices.},
